# Abstract

This __Four in a Row 3D__ board game demonstrates the use of the Artificial Intelligence method Monte Carlo Tree Search
with UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds) applied to trees (UCT in short). Four in a Row 3D is a two player abstract strategy game
with perfect information. This implementation allows any combination of human players and artificial intelligence players
as chosen from the options menu.

# Rules

Two players place beads of their own color on a selected pole of their choice during their turn. The game is played in alternating the player's turn between the two players. The player controlling the red beads starts the game. Passing a turn is not allowed.

First player with four beads of own color in a row wins. Building a row can be done in any direction inside the grid of 64 positions in straight line.
